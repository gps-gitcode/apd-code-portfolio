## R Markdown

The purpose of this R Markdown document to consolidate the all learning material that i came across during the learning cycle of course 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
